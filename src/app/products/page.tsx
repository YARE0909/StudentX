                The Management Hub is the central nerve center, standardizing
                data, enforcing policies, and orchestrating workflows across all
                suites. Each suite is a single, feature-rich product for its
                operational area, exchanging events and metrics via the Hub.
                Analytics produces insights, Communication delivers messages,
                Compliance enforces governance, and Operations keeps everything
                on schedule.
